## [3.3.2] - 2025-02-21

### Added
- **Announcement Broadcasting**: Teachers and Admins can now send custom announcements to targeted groups (e.g., all Parents, or specific classes).
- **Notification Center**: A new bell icon in the header with a real-time unread badge and dropdown feed for all system alerts and custom announcements.
- **Recipient Targeting**: Broadcast engine resolves recipients based on roles and class assignments automatically.

## [3.3.1] - 2025-02-21

### Added
- **Sidebar Mode Configuration**: Added a new setting to choose between a "Fixed" (always expanded) and "Collapsible" (mini version with hover expansion) sidebar on desktop. This allows users to customize their navigation experience and workspace density.

## [3.3.0] - 2025-02-21

### Improved
- **Standardized Month Formatting**: Implemented a more compact date convention ("Dec, 2025" instead of "December 2025") across all tables, reports, and subtitles. This saves significant space in financial ledgers and improves mobile visibility.
- **Enhanced Dropdowns**: Month selection dropdowns now show abbreviated labels ("Jan", "Feb") while preserving full names internally for database stability.
